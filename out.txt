Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join haproxy.bigsfintech.local:6443 --token vb8yo1.5yuwvv6qk0fgyam7 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:90f8cf1ae0b0bc51fc378f07cd346fd2379dbc5dc4c9ef2c58da0653211e5592
